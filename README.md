# 4232-Project
Final Game Project for ITCS 4232

OBJECTIVE

Find and defeat the six bosses located in dungeons throughout the overworld.
Collect the six orbs needed to enter the final dungeon and finish the game.

CONTROLS

Move with WASD.
Cast spells with arrow keys.
Change current spell with E.

TIPS

Fountains with grass growing around them rapidly refill your MP.
The Red, Green, and Blue orbs increase your max MP and your MP regen.
The Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow orbs each give you access to a new spell.
The Bonfire and Firebolt spells destroy dry bushes and clear a path.
The Thunder spell destroys every enemy in a room as well as the spikes during a boss battle.

NOTES AND KNOWN ISSUES

The Thunder spell does not deal any damage to bosses.
Boss rooms are persistent, so you could leave at any point during a boss fight and the boss will be in the same state when you return.
All of the bosses have the exact same behavior. They're just different colors.
